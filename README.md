```

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (3.9+ recommended)
- **Gemini API Key** (free from Google AI Studio)
- **About 2GB free space** (for AI models and legal documents)
- **Internet connection** (for AI model downloads on first run)

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key (it's free!)
3. Copy the key - you'll need it in step 4

### 2. Download & Setup
```bash
# Clone or download this project
cd ADGM_CORP_AGENT1

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Your Legal Documents
Put your ADGM legal reference documents (PDFs or Word docs) in the `data/adgm_laws/` folder. These should be things like:
- ADGM Companies Regulations
- Employment Regulations  
- Registration requirements
- Standard forms and templates

### 4. Configure API Key
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5. Build Legal Knowledge Base
```bash
python ingest.py
```
This will process all your legal documents and create a searchable knowledge base.

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app/ui.py
```

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:8501` with the application ready to use!

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Upload Documents** - Drag & drop your .docx files
2. **Wait for Processing** - Watch the progress bar as AI analyzes each document
3. **Review Results** - Check summaries, compliance issues, and missing documents
4. **Download Reports** - Get JSON analysis and commented Word documents

### Document Types Supported
- Articles of Association
- Memorandum of Association  
- Board Resolutions
- Shareholder Resolutions
- Employment Contracts
- UBO Declarations
- Commercial Agreements
- Licensing Applications
- And more...

### Process Types Detected
- **Company Incorporation** - Setting up a new company
- **Licensing & Regulatory Filings** - Getting permits and renewals
- **Employment & HR** - Hiring and employment documentation
- **Commercial Agreements** - Business contracts and deals
- **Compliance & Risk** - Internal policies and procedures

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "RAG database is empty" Error
```bash
# Make sure you ran the ingestion step
python ingest.py

# Check if it worked
python -c "from app.rag import debug_rag_database; debug_rag_database()"
```

### "No API Key" Error
- Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct API key
- Check there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Try restarting the application

### "Rate Limit" or "Quota Exceeded" Errors
**Problem**: Gemini free tier has daily/monthly limits
**Solutions**:
- **Wait and retry** - Free tier resets daily
- **Upgrade to paid Gemini** - Much higher limits for heavy usage
- **Switch AI model** - Edit `app/models/llm_client.py` to use OpenAI, Claude, or other providers
- **Process fewer documents** at once to stay within limits

### Documents Not Processing
- Make sure files are `.docx` format (not `.doc`)
- Check file isn't corrupted by opening in Word first
- Ensure files aren't password protected

### Slow Performance
- First run is slower (downloads AI models)
- Large documents take longer to process
- Consider splitting very large documents

## 💡 Important Notes

### API Usage & Costs
- **Gemini Free Tier**: 15 requests/minute, 1,500 requests/day, 1M requests/month
- **For heavy usage**: Consider upgrading to Gemini Pro ($7/1M tokens)
- **Alternative AI models**: System supports switching to OpenAI, Claude, or others
- **Tip**: Process documents in small batches to stay within free limits

### First Run Setup

- **All processing happens locally** on your machine
- **Only text snippets** are sent to Gemini AI for analysis (not full documents)
- **No data is stored** by Google or external services
- **Legal documents stay on your computer**

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Issues
- **SSL Warnings**: These are harmless and don't affect functionality
- **Model Download**: First run downloads ~500MB of AI models
- **Memory Usage**: Large document sets may use 2-4GB RAM

### Need Support?
If you run into issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Look at the console output for error messages
3. Try the debug commands to isolate the problem

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Adding Custom Legal Requirements
Edit the rules in `app/rules.py` to add your own compliance checks.

### Custom Document Types
Add new document patterns in `app/parser.py` to detect additional document types.

### API Integration
The analysis results are available as structured JSON - perfect for integrating with other systems.

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Issue Severity Levels
- 🔴 **High**: Critical compliance failures, missing required clauses
- 🟡 **Medium**: Important but not critical issues, best practices
- 🟢 **Low**: Minor suggestions, formatting improvements

### Document Status
- ✅ **Complete**: All required documents present and compliant
- 🟡 **Issues Found**: Documents present but have compliance problems  
- ❌ **Missing**: Required documents not uploaded
